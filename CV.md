## Hugo Sykes

I'm a Maths and Physics graduate who has spent a year in hospitality eagerly awaiting the opportunity
to make something of my degree. Now I'm enrolled onto one of the most demanding and competitive
coding bootcamps in the world: Makers Academy. I discovered coding whilst at university, but only
recently have I become a fanatic.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Analysis

Throughout years of studying and using Mathematics, I have developed my skills of analysis in general.
I instinctively spot trends and recognise patterns. I am then naturally drawn to their significance
and the understanding that can be inferred from in-depth analysis of these patterns.

Having done work experience and internships in the financial sector, I have developed an understanding of the kind of analysis which benefits financial institutions and the myriad ways in which they attempt to develop it.
