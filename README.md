## Hugo Sykes

I'm a Maths and Physics graduate who has spent a year in hospitality eagerly awaiting the opportunity to make something of my degree. Now I've completed the most demanding and competitive of coding bootcamps: Makers Academy. I discovered coding whilst at university, but only recently have I become a fanatic.

I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic full-stack developer looking for a growth oriented environment in which to keep up the pace of my learning.

## Skills

#### Analysis

Throughout years of studying and using Mathematics, I have developed my skills of analysis in general. I instinctively spot trends and recognise patterns. I am then naturally drawn to their significance and the deeper understanding to be inferred.

Having done work experience and internships in the financial sector, I have developed an understanding of the kind of analysis which benefits financial institutions and the myriad ways in which they attempt to develop it. This is transferrable to any data-driven analysis and I am keen to develop my skills in this area.

#### Programming

Learning at Maker's Academy has transformed me into a junior developer who's evangelical about test-driven development and dedicated to furthering my learning and keeping up the pace of acquisition of coding languages, good practices and architectures.
